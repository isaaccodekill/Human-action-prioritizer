Methods and Supporting Data

This solution meets all of Project Drawdown’s criteria for global climate solutions.

Carpooling entails increasing the occupancy of passengercars, including taxis, pickup trucks, motorhomes, passenger vans and other suchvehiclesbut not including two- or three-wheeled, freight, public transit, or commercial vehicles, such as buses, heavy trucks, and commercial vans. It replaces the practice of driving alone.

We define Increase Carpooling as having at least one passenger per car in addition to the driver (two passengers forride-hailing). We consider a fully adopted carpool trip as having 2 passengers for a car occupancy of three. New adoption is considered as anypassenger kilometer(pkm)/yravoided from an increase in the 2023 current adoption baseline (average occupancy of 1.5).

Carpooling involves transporting multiple people in a single car. Because carpooling increases the number of passengers per vehicle, it reduces emissions per pkm (International Transport Forum [ITF], 2021). However, the actual impact depends on how the carpool trip is organized – for example, whether it replaces solo car trips or shifts people away from public or active transport.

Carpooling is generally more efficient when ride-matching is optimized. If trips involve detours to pick up passengers, the benefits can be reduced. Similarly, carpooling may offer less advantage in areas with strong public transportation systems if it replaces public transport use (Schaller, 2021).

In addition to reducing emissions ofCO₂,methane,nitrous oxide, andblack carbon(ITF, 2023), carpooling can help alleviate traffic congestion and reduce demand for parking (Dong et al., 2025). It may also lower transportation costs for participants (Fulton et al., 2020). However, the full benefits depend on usage patterns, geographic context, and integration with other transport modes.


## What could cause effectiveness to change?


This range reflects the variation in expert estimates of effectiveness at addressing climate change. Effectiveness can change based on how this solution is implemented and what other changes occur alongside it.

Lower effectiveness means fewer GHG emissions cut per adoption unit. This is the 25th percentile of the effectiveness values found in our assessment.

Higher effectiveness means more GHG emissions cut per adoption unit. This is the 75th percentile of the effectiveness values found in our assessment.

This is the median of the effectiveness values found in our assessment.


## What is this range based on?


We define adoption as million pkm avoided annually above current car occupancy levels. The low end of the slider represents minimum adoption (no increase above current levels). High achievable adoption (the slider’s high value) is based on the highest current car occupancy at the country level.

This is the low end of the range for estimated achievable adoption, based on car occupancy of 1.7 people.

This is the high end of the range for estimated achievable adoption, based on car occupancy of 2.7 people.

This is the minimum adoption of this solution.


## What calculations are required to get Climate Impact in Gt CO₂-eq/yr?


Climate Impact = Effectiveness x Adoption / 10⁹

59.09 Gt CO₂‑eq/yr
 (100-yr basis) and 79.18 Gt CO₂‑eq/yr
 (20-yr basis) in 2019, the latest official data available from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

Every million pkm shifted from car trips (at the current car occupancy) to fully adopted carpool trips avoids 54.71t/CO₂‑eqon a100-yr basis(Table 1) or 55.28 t/CO₂‑eq
 on a20-yr basis.

We found this by calculating baseline carGHGemissions from the global private vehicle fleet, by multiplying the tailpipe emissions intensities of different types of fuels (g/MJ) by the energy intensity of travel by vehicles using those fuels (MJ/vkm) (EVDatabase, 2024; Graba et al., 2023; International Energy Agency [IEA], 2021; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC], 2006; ITF, 2020; Mamala et al., 2021; Tsai et al., 2018; U.S. Department of Energy [DOE], 2017). These equaled 112.4 t/CO₂‑eq
/million pkm on a 100-year basis (113.6 t/CO₂‑eq
/million pkm on a 20-year basis). We multiplied these emissions by the average occupancy of each vehicle type (ITF, 2020) to produce an averageemissions intensityfor CO₂,
 methane, and nitrous oxide for every vehicle type. We then combined these into a global weighted average based on the percentage of each type of vehicle (electric, hybrid andfossil fuel–powered) in the global fleet (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe [UNECE], 2023). The result is a car baseline for the global average emissions intensity of passenger cars.

We then used the global GHG emissions intensity to calculate carpool emissions based on the carpool car occupancy and subtracted them from the baseline car occupancy to determine emissions avoided.

Table 1. Effectiveness at reducing emissions.

Unit: t CO₂‑eq
 (100-year basis)/million pkm avoided

It costs US$0.34/pkm to run a car (at current global average occupancy of 1.5 (ITF, 2020)), including car purchase and maintenance costs, fuel, etc., but excluding indirect costs such as the value of time spent driving a car. It costs US$0.17/pkm for a fully adopted carpool ride (car occupancy of 3). This is a savings of US$170,662/million pkm (AAA, 2022; Burnham et al., 2021; Gössling et al., 2019, 2022). These direct financial costs do not include estimates of additional fuel needed due to additional weight of passengers or additional mileage due to pick up and drop off.

This amounts to savings of US$3,119 t CO₂‑eq
 on a 100-year basis (Table 2) or US$3,087 t CO₂‑eq
 avoided emissions on a 20-year basis.

Unit: US$ (2023) per t CO₂‑eq
 (100-year basis)

Carpooling is a behavioral solution, so its performance can improve over time through scaling, experience, and social normalization but not at a quantifiablelearning rate.

The most important mechanism for increasing carpooling is behavioral familiarity. As people become accustomed to carpooling, social and psychological barriers decline (Adelé & Dionisio, 2020; Malodia & Singla, 2016). Another mechanism that can improve carpooling performance is platform optimization. As apps and algorithms improve, matching riders becomes faster and more efficient (Beed et al., 2020; Santi et al., 2014). Network effects can also improve performance. More users increase the chance of shared trips, reducing wait times and detours (Dong et al., 2025; Manik & Molkenthin, 2020). Over time, through policy support and incentives, cities may develop dedicated lanes, subsidies, or integration with public transport, improving performance (Anthopoulos & Tzimos, 2021; Bachmann et al., 2018).

Speed of actionrefers to how quickly a climate solutionphysicallyaffectsthe atmosphere after it is deployed. This is different fromspeed of deployment, which is the pace at which solutions are adopted.

At Project Drawdown, we define the speed of action for each climate solution asemergency brake,gradual, ordelayed.

Increase Carpooling is aGRADUALclimate solution. It has a steady, linear impact on the atmosphere. The cumulative effect over time builds as a straight line.

The current car occupancy is 1.5 persons per car (ITF, 2020). Approximately 2 billion cars are in use worldwide (WHO, 2022). To convert this number into pkm traveled by car, we needed to determine the average pkm that each passenger car travels per year. Using population-weighted data from several countries, we found that the average car carries 1.5 people and travels about 19,500 vkm/yr, or an average of 29,250 pkm/yr. Multiplying this by the number of cars in use gives the total travel distance by cars with the current occupancy. This corresponds to about 59 trillion pkm traveled by car worldwide each year.

Current car occupancy is from a global average (ITF, 2020), and adoption trend and achievable adoption are based on reported car occupancy from Belgium, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Romania, United Kingdom, United States, and the European Union (Armoogum et al., 2022; Davis & Boundy, 2022; European Environment Agency [EEA], 2000; Fiorello et al., 2016; Franckx, 2024; Wolfram et al., 2020).

Since 1.5 persons per car is the current occupancy average, we define adoption as the increase in avoided pkm/yr as a result of increased occupancy above 1.5. For this reason, current adoption is represented as zero (Table 3), and potential adoption in Table 6 is the increase in million pkm avoided each year.

Table 3. Current (2024) adoption level.

Unit: million pkm/yr avoided above current levels

Average world car occupancy has been flat since the 1990s after declining from higher occupancy in the 1970s. Therefore, we set the adoption trend to zero (Table 4).

For example, car occupancy in the United States decreased from 1.9 in 1977 to 1.7 in 2009 and held steady at 1.7 in 2017 (Davis & Boundy, 2022). The European Union car occupancy decreased from 2.0 in 1970 to 1.5 in 1990, where it has held steady (EEA, 2000). Despite the emergence of carpooling platforms like BlaBlaCar, Carpoolworld, Liftshare, Participation, Lyft, and Uber Share (formerly known as) Uber Pool, overall car occupancy has remained largely unchanged. These advances have improved convenience and access, but structural barriers such as travel time mismatches, privacy preferences, and urban sprawl continue to limit adoption.

Table 4. Adoption trend (2023–2024).

Unit: million pkm/yr avoided above current levels

Theadoption ceilingfor increasing carpooling is equal to the pkm/yr avoidance if every car trip is a fully adopted carpool trip instead of the baseline adoption. Using a population-weighted mean of the average distance (in pkm) traveled per car annually, this translates to about 19.71 trillion pkm/yr avoided (Table 5). We assume that all of these trips can be made by carpool, regardless of purpose or distance.

Romania reports a car occupancy of 2.7 (Fiorello et al., 2016), more than double the multi-occupancy of countries like the United States, where occupancy has remained around 1.5–1.7 for decades (Davis & Boundy, 2022; ITF, 2020; Wolfram et al., 2020). This demonstrates that significantly higher occupancy is not only possible but already practiced in certain contexts.

Table 5. Adoption ceiling: upper limit for adoption level.

Unit: million pkm/yr avoided above current levels

Current car occupancy is useful for identifying globally achievable occupancy (Armoogum et al., 2022; Davis & Boundy, 2022; EEA, 2000; Fiorello et al., 2016; Franckx, 2024; ITF, 2023; Wolfram et al., 2020).

To determine the high achievable level of carpool adoption, we assumed that every country could reach the highest adoption foranycountry. Romania had the highest reported average car occupancy at 2.7 (Fiorello et al., 2016) in 2016. We therefore set our high adoption at 2.7. This corresponds to 17.5 trillion pkm/yr avoided (Table 6).

To identify a lower feasible level of carpool adoption, we took the historical average reported estimates for global car occupancy. This corresponds to a car occupancy of 1.7, or 5 trillion pkm/yr avoided by carpooling (Table 6).

Table 6. Range of achievable adoption levels.

Unit: million pkm/yr avoided above current levels

If average car occupancy globally reaches the low end of the achievable range of 1.7, it will avoid 0.254GtCO₂‑eq/yr
 GHG emissions (100-yr basis) over the current state.

If average car occupancy reaches 2.7 (the high end of the achievable range), it will avoid 0.959 Gt CO₂‑eq/yr
 GHG emissions (100-yr basis) over the current state.

If carpooling is fully adopted at a global average car occupancy of 3.0 (adoption ceiling), it would avoid 1.079 Gt CO₂‑eq/yr
 GHG emissions on a 100-yr basis.

Unit: Gt CO₂‑eq
 per year avoided, 100-yr basis

Carpooling can save money through shared travel costs between passengers (Chan & Shaheen, 2012; Molina et al., 2020; Shaheen et al., 2024). One study estimated that adding one passenger for every 100 vehicles, excluding any additional travel, could avoid 800–820 million gallons of gasoline each year in the United States (Jacobson & King, 2009). Actual cost savings would depend on the price of gasoline and any additional travel required to pick up passengers. These savings may be especially beneficial for low-income households (Zhou et al., 2020).

Tailpipe emissions frominternal combustion enginecars are associated with asthma, lung cancer, increased emergency department visits for respiratory disease, and increased mortality (Anenberg et al., 2019; Guarnieri & Balmes, 2014; Pan et al., 2023; Pennington et al., 2024; Requia et al., 2018; Szyszkowicz et al., 2018). Urban areas, and often those in low- and middle-income countries, experience disproportionately higher vehicle emissions and higher health impacts (Anenberg et al., 2019; Kinney et al., 2011). By reducing vehicle miles traveled, carpooling can reduce vehicle emissions and associated health impacts (Shaheen et al., 2024). A reduction in vehicle miles traveled can improve traffic congestion and road safety (Shaheen et al., 2024). Carpooling is associated with several psychological benefits, including improved sociability and reduced commute stress (Chan & Shaheen, 2012; Molina et al., 2020).

Communities that are lower income or rich in racial and ethnic minorities tend to be located near highways and major traffic corridors, and so are disproportionately exposed to air pollution (Kerr et al., 2021). Carpooling can reduce the impacts of air pollution on these populations (Shaheen et al., 2024). In the United States, carpooling can increase the accessibility of transportation for low-income, racial and ethnic minority, or immigrant populations who cannot afford personal vehicles or cannot attain driver’s licenses (Liu & Painter, 2012; Shaheen et al., 2024). Enhanced access to transportation broadly is important for increasing economic equality by providing households with income-earning opportunities.

Tailpipe emissions from internal combustion engine cars containparticulate matter,sulfur oxides, nitrous oxides,carbon monoxide, andvolatile organic compounds(Union of Concerned Scientists, 2023). Carpooling is associated with reduced energy consumption and reduced emissions from internal combustion engine cars (Molina et al., 2020; Shaheen et al., 2024). Carpooling can reduce traffic congestion, though the magnitude of this reduction is uncertain (Chan & Shaheen, 2011). One study in Langfang, China, found that carpooling can reduce trips during the morning and evening commuting hours, reducing vehicle volume and increasing travel speeds for both carpooling and non-carpooling cars (Li et al., 2018).

Carpooling often falters due to the difficulty of aligning multiple participants’ schedules. Commuters face mismatched work hours, unexpected delays, or shifting routines, raising stress and reducing reliability. Comfort and privacy are additional deterrents because many travelers prefer the autonomy and personal space of driving alone. Trust and safety concerns also play a major role – riding with strangers raises worries about reliability and personal security (Cellina et al., 2024).

Accessibility further complicates adoption. In low-density areas, the limited pool of potential passengers makes ride-matching impractical, while in urban areas cultural resistance and ingrained travel habits hinder uptake (Friman et al., 2020). Finally, digital divides restrict participation in app-based systems, excluding those without reliable smartphone or internet access.

When carpooling uses platform operators it generates some emissions from server use, data processing, and administrative activities. These operational emissions are small compared to the reductions achieved.

Carpooling services could induce additional car use, especially if they offer convenience and low costs that attract people who would otherwise not have traveled or would have used lower-emission modes. This is a form of therebound effect, where efficiency gains are offset by increased travel demand.

Carpooling may raise safety and security concerns, particularly in informal or app-based systems where passengers share rides with strangers. Concerns around personal safety, especially for women and marginalized groups, can limit adoption or require regulatory oversight.

Promoting carpooling without coordination with public transport policy could erode ridership on bus or rail systems. This could weaken investment in public transit and make systems less viable, especially in low-density or suburban areas.

Carpooling reduces the number of vehicles on the road per trip but still relies on cars rather than shifting demand toward lower-impact modes such aspublic transitornonmotorized transportation.

Carpooling requires changes in user behavior and social norms, rather than technological innovation. While this avoids the environmental and financial costs of new infrastructure or vehicles, it can be challenging because it depends on people being willing to alter their travel habits, coordinate with others, and potentially sacrifice convenience or privacy.

The extent of emission reduction depends on how many people share the ride and whether the carpool replaces trips that would have otherwise been made using more sustainable transport modes (e.g., walking, cycling, or public transport).

The environmental benefits of carpooling vary based on travel behavior and context. If carpooling fills otherwise empty seats in cars already on the road, it can be highly efficient. However, if it results in route detours or deadheading or if people shift from using transit to carpooling, the net benefit may be smaller or even negative.

Carpooling can reduce the overall number of cars needed for transportation, which in turn can decrease congestion and urban parking demand. However, this benefit is limited if carpooling is only used during peak hours or if it competes with active or public transport options.

Carpooling reinforces non-car transportation modes by extending reach, offering first- and last-mile connections, and providing flexible options where fixed-route services are limited.

## Consensus ofeffectivenessin decarbonizing the transport sector: Mixed


There is a high level of consensus among major organizations working in the area of climate solutions that carpooling can substantially reduce GHG emissions. Fewer vehicles mean less fuel burned per pkm. However, research on the real-world effectiveness of carpooling is mixed. Carpooling has remained largely flat for decades despite policy incentives and the advent of ride-sharing platforms, limiting its overall contribution to emission reductions. Additionally, rebound effects may occur or if carpoolers would otherwise have taken public transit, walked, or biked, thereby offsetting some emission avoidance.

Globally, cars and vans were responsible for 3.8 Gt CO₂‑eq emissions in 2023 – more than 60% of road transport emissions (IEA, 2024).

Large-scale carpooling can significantly reduce fuel consumption and emissions, with studies in Shanghai showing reductions of 15–23% depending on adoption scenarios, and additional efficiency gains from improved traffic flow (Yan et al., 2020).

Carpooling can substantially reduce vehicle activity. Jalali et al. (2017) found up to a 24% decrease in total distance driven and a 40% reduction in vehicle trips under optimal conditions in Changsha, China, which translates into daily CO₂ emission reductions of around 4 tons.

Simulations on university campuses showed potential reductions of 5% in CO₂ and 7% in nitrous oxide emissions, alongside a 7% increase in average speed and an 8% reduction in travel time with increased adoption of carpooling (Tomas et al., 2021).

The results presented in this document summarize findings from 15 reviews and meta-analyses and 24 original studies reflecting current evidence from 52 countries. We recognize this limited geographic scope creates bias, and hope this work inspires research and data sharing on this topic in underrepresented regions.
